<h1>Contact ExplodingEmail</h1>
<a href="/">Back to home</a>
<p>Hello!  This site is run by one person, so I may not have great response times.</p>
<p>I will try to have a 1-2 day response time by email, or <a href="https://discord.gg/GHapeHPWVS">by Discord</a> for informal
questions or help in less than a day.</p>

<b>Important: emails will only receive a reply from dispatch@exploding.email, regardless of the one emailed.</b>

<h2>Email for general questions</h2>
<a href="mailto:contact@exploding.email">contact@exploding.email</a>

<p>
    Emails that end in common addresses (such as @gmail.com, @outlook.com, etc.) will be ignored.<br>
    Since we do not store data, it is incredibly unlikely that you would need to submit one of these, but if, for whatever reason, you need to submit one, please use an address relating to your company or organization.
