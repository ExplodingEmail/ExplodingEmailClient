# ExplodingEmail Client
<hr>

Generate temporary email addresses using this service!

[View it here!](https://exploding.email)

## How does it work?

ExplodingEmail generates a brand-new email address upon visiting the website.  This email can be used
to signup for sites (such as sites that require a verified email to download something).

Upon receiving the email, ExplodingEmail sends it directly to you via a WebSocket.  After the server
sends you the email, it is permanently erased from our end.  We do not keep ANY logs on your data.

To see for yourself, you can check the source code of the repository.
