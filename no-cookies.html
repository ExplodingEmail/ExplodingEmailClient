<h2>that's right Hal, no cookies.</h2>
<p>We use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> to store your resume token<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>The nature of this site is pro-privacy, so why would we track you?</p>
<p>This site is proxied through Cloudflare, which may use your IP address to block potential DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we do not collect logs on anything.</p>

    <p>1: the resume token allows you to close the tab and re-enter the site and use the email you had before (in case you closed the tab or something)
    <br>
    Some browsers may mess with localStorage and not store it.</p>
