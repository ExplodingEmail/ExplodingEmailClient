        <h2>What is ExplodingEmail?</h2>
        <p>
            ExplodingEmail, otherwise known as a disposable email generator, is a website which generates disposable email addresses to use on websites.
            A lot of websites which require you to sign up for an account to use certain features, require you to use an email address,
            and some of them require you to verify it.  In a world of spam, low security, and non-privacy, this is a problem.  This website is designed to
            solve this problem by generating disposable email addresses which can be used on websites without you having to give up your real email address.
            This is also safer than using an email dedicated for potential spam websites, as you can generate one email per-website, making it so multiple
            companies cannot build a profile on you based on your email address.  While it might sound difficult to track a user based on an email address,
            <a href="https://nothingprivate.ml/" rel="noreferrer">it is not only possible</a>, but non-trivial, to track based on elements such as user agents, IP addresses,
            and other browser features which can easily be used for tracking.<br><br>
            ExplodingEmail does not keep ANY logs on your emails.  As proof of this, when an email is received on our end and sent to you, it is instantly
            erased from our servers.  This also means that if you are not on the webpage while you receive an email, it will be erased as well.  In a world
            where privacy is decaying, every little bit counts to reclaim it.<br><br>
            <b>Want to check if one of your email addresses has been part of a breach?</b>
            <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noreferrer">Have I Been Pwned</a> is a website which checks if an email address has been part of a breach.
            Using your email address and the password from the pwned website, hackers can try the email/password on other websites if you re-use the same password
            (this is why using the same password on different websites is a bad idea).  Using ExplodingEmail for websites that you do not want to give your real
            email to will help prevent this, as that email will not be associated with any other website.
